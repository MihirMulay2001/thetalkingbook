We believe that education is the building block of our society and nothing should come in the way of a childâ€™s education. <br/>
Our startup was built during the pandemic with the intention of bringing quality education to the students directly at home. <br/>

We are beginning by targeting the younger students by creating the perfect learning companion that will help them learn faster by making use of Auditory Learning.
